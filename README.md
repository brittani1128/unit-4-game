# Crystal Collector!

## Project Overview

Crystal Collector is an interactive game for web browsers that makes use of the jQuery library. 

At the start of each game, a target score is given. To win, the player must reach the target score by selecting on a combination of crystals. Each crystal has a point value that is hidden to them before the game begins. If the player goes over the target score, they lose.
